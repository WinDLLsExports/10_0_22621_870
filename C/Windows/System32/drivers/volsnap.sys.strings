An attempt to flush and hold writes on volume %2 was attempted while another flush and hold was already in progress.
An error occurred while trying to delete a snapshot of %2.  The delete will be retried at a later time.
An unfinished create of a shadow copy of volume %2 was deleted.
An volume offline for cluster failover was expected, but a mount request arrived instead.  A failure occurred attempting to take the volume offline to compensate.

The flush and hold operation for volume %2 was aborted because of low available system memory.
The flush and hold writes operation on volume %2 timed out while waiting for a release writes command.
The flush and hold writes operation on volume %2 timed out while waiting for file system cleanup.
The oldest shadow copy of volume %2 was deleted to allow shadow copies created afterward and marked for delete to be deleted.
The oldest shadow copy of volume %2 was deleted to keep disk space usage for shadow copies of volume %2 below the user defined limit.
The oldest shadow copy of volume %2 was deleted to keep the total number of shadow copies of volume %2 below a limit.
The revert operation on volume %2 encountered a bad sector error.  Please validate the data on this volume.
The revert operation on volume %2 stopped because of the loss of a volume.  When the volume is re-introduced, the revert will continue.  You may have to reboot to trigger the revert.
The reverting of volume %2 is being restarted.  This is most likely because of a system shutdown or a system crash.
The reverting of volume %2 to the state of a previous shadow copy is complete.
The shadow copies of volume %2 were aborted because of a failed free space computation.
The shadow copies of volume %2 were aborted because of an IO failure on volume %3.
The shadow copies of volume %2 were aborted because of insufficient paged heap.
The shadow copies of volume %2 were aborted because the shadow copy storage could not grow due to a user imposed limit.
The shadow copies of volume %2 were aborted because the shadow copy storage failed to grow.
The shadow copies of volume %2 were aborted because the shadow copy storage volume was not present in time during a previous session.
The shadow copies of volume %2 were aborted because the shadow copy storage volume was not present.

The shadow copies of volume %2 were aborted because volume %3, which contains shadow copy storage for this shadow copy, was force dismounted.
The shadow copies of volume %2 were aborted during detection because a critical control file could not be opened.
The shadow copies of volume %2 were aborted during detection.
The shadow copies of volume %2 were deleted because the shadow copy storage could not grow in time.  Consider reducing the IO load on the system or choose a shadow copy storage volume that is not being shadow copied.
The shadow copy of volume %2 being created failed to install.
The shadow copy of volume %2 could not be created because volume %3, which is specified as the location for shadow copy storage, is not an NTFS volume or an error was encountered while trying to determine the file system type of this volume.
The shadow copy of volume %2 could not be created due to a failure in creating the necessary on disk structures.
The shadow copy of volume %2 could not be created due to insufficient non-paged memory pool for a bitmap structure.
The shadow copy of volume %2 could not be created due to insufficient resources for worker threads.
The shadow copy of volume %2 could not create a new paged heap.  The system may be low on virtual memory.
